"""
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. 
This means that the item that is inserted first will be the first one to be removed. 
Think of it like a real-world queue of people waiting in line â€“ 
the person who arrives first is the first one to leave the line when it's their turn.

Queues are commonly used in computer science and software development for various applications, 
such as task scheduling, managing resources, and more.
